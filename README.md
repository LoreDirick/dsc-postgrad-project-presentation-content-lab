# Project Presentations - Lab

## Introduction

Using the questions and points from the **audience questions**, the **storytelling key points**, and the **project outline** drafted in an earlier exercise, now you can focus on enhancing your own student projects. 

## Objectives

You will be able to:

- Apply content review techniques to your own presentation material and revise its contents

## Audience Questions
Here are the guiding questions we used in the last section:


| Audience Questions |
| ---------- |
| 1. Who will be receiving your presentation and, if relevant, what is their role in the company?	|
| 2. What is their background: technical or non-technical?                                        |
| 3. How will your presentation affect their work or a decision they need to make?                |
| 4. What is their attention span?                                                                | 
| 5. What is the goal of the presentation?                                                        |


## Storytelling Key Points

In practical terms, your presentation should have three parts:

- Tell them what you're going to tell them
  - [ ] the problem
  - [ ] the solution
  - [ ] the data and tools you will use to solve it
- Tell them
  - [ ] a deeper description of the data and relevant variables
  - [ ] what type of problem the business problem is in statistial terms (prediction, optimization, classification, prediction)
  - [ ] the findings of your analysis
- Tell them what you told them
  - [ ] how your solution solves the business problem
  - [ ] how much better your solution is than the baseline model in solving the business problem
  - [ ] what impacts your confidence in the solution, limitations
  - [ ] how to build off your work with next steps and future work
  
## Minimum Slide Outline

With a slide for each point, at a minimum you should have:

- [ ] introduction
- [ ] business context
- [ ] data 
- [ ] process steps
- [ ] results & business application (recommendations)
- [ ] evaluation & future improvement ideas 
- [ ] contact information


When you're done, save your updated content.

## Summary

Great job! You will focus on slide design in the next section.
