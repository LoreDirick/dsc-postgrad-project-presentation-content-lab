# Project Presenation Content Lab

Using the questions and points from your **audience questions**, the **story telling key points**, and the **project outline** drafted in an earlier exercise; now you can focus on enhancing your own student projects. Here are the guiding questions we used inn  the last section:

## Audience Questions

| Audience Question |
|----------|
| 1. Who will be receiving your presentation and what is their roll in the company? | 
| 2. What is their background, technical or non-technical? | 
| 3. How will your presentation affect their work or a decision they need to make? | 
| 4. What is their attention span? | 
| 5. What is the goal of the presentation? | 

## Story telling key points

In practical terms, your presentation should have three parts:
- Tell them what you're going to tell them
  - [ ] the problem
  - [ ] the solution
  - [ ] the data and tools you will use to solve it
- Tell them
  - [ ] A deeper description of the data and relevant variables
  - [ ] what type of problem the business problem is in statistial terms (prediction, optimization, classification, prediction)
  - [ ] The findings of your analysis
- Tell them what you told them
  - [ ] How your solution solves the business problem
  - [ ] How much better your solution is than the baseline model in solving the business problem
  - [ ] What impacts your confidence in the solution, limitations
  - [ ] How to build off your work with next steps and future work
  
## Minimum slide outline

With a slide for each point, at a minimum you should have:

- [ ] introduction
- [ ] business context
- [ ] data 
- [ ] science process steps (a few slides)
- [ ] results & business application (another few slides)
- [ ] evaluation & future improvement ideas (easily more than one slide)
- [ ] contact info. (1 slide)
  

## Save your updated content when complete. You will focus on slide design in the next section.
